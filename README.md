CloudFuse is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that enables developers to deploy applications written in multiple programming languages with minimal configuration. Inspired by platforms like Fly.io and Heroku, CloudFuse provides a global platform for running apps with built-in scaling, networking, and observability.

## Features

- **Framework detection**: Automatic detection of Laravel, Spring Boot, Django, Express, Rails, etc.
- **Global edge network**: Deploy applications close to your users
- **Container-based**: Docker and Kubernetes powered infrastructure
- **Developer-friendly**:
  - CLI tool for managing applications
  - Web dashboard for monitoring
  - Comprehensive API with Swagger documentation
- **Enterprise-ready**:
  - Role-based access control
  - Audit logging
  - Usage quotas and billing
